TODO:
1. continue to learn KeyValueHeap.java which is used in RegionScannerImpl to
do store merges

Question:
1. can a client call one region server to get data from another one?

Call Trace:
1. get request
  RPC SERVER SIDE:
  hbase-server/regionserver/...
  RSRpcServices.java      1562    get() calls HRegion.getClosestRowBefore()
                                  and HRegion.get() on line 1583 and 1590
                                  respectively.
  HServer.java            4735    Result get() wraps List<Cell> get()
                                  method on line 4747.
  HServer.java            4756    List<Cell> get() calls RegionScanner.next()
                                  on line 4773.
  HServer.java            3698    RegionScannerImpl implements the interface
                                  RegionScanner.
  HServer.java            3817    next() calls nextRaw() on line 3826, which
                                  then calls nextInternal() on line 3847.
  HServer.java            3918    nextInternal()

2. scan request
3. put request
4. split a region
  RPC CLIENT SIDE:
  hbase-client/...
  client/HBaseAdmin.java  2007    split() calls the ProtobufUtil.split()
                                  method.
  protobuf/ProtobufUtil.java
                          1691    split() wraps the
                                  AdminService.BlockingInterface.splitRegion()
                                  RPC method.
                          

  RPC SERVER SIDE:
  hbase-server/regionserver/...
  RSRpcServices.java      683     The constructor exposes its own services
                                  to the rpcServer by calling getServices()
                                  on line 713.
  RSRpcServices.java      818     getServices() returns a list of all RPC
                                  services provided by RSRpcServices including 
                                  RSRpcServices.splitRegion() by 
                                  calling newReflectiveBlockingService(this),
                                  AdminService and ClientService are generated
                                  classes under

  RSRpcServices.java      1435    splitRegion() calls HRegion.checkSplit() 
                                  on line 1449 to get splitpoints. It then
                                  calls HRegion.startRegionOperation() to 
                                  acquire the lock. After that, it calls 
                                  HRegion.forceSplit() to set the split flag
                                  and splitting points. Finally, it calls
                                  CompactSplitThread.requestSplit() to force
                                  instant split.
  CompactSplitThread.java 214     requestSplit() uses a SplitRequest object as
                                  a parameter when calling
                                  ThreadPoolExecutor.execute() to execute the
                                  split request on line 221.
  SplitRequest.java       57      run() calls  SplitTransaction.execute() on
                                  line 82 to execute the split transaction.
  SplitTransaction.java   565     execute() calls createDaughters() which in
                                  turn calls stepsBeforePONR() to create two
                                  daughter regions. Then it calls
                                  stepsAfterPONR() which in turn calls 
                                  openDaughters() to open the two daughter 
                                  regions.
  HRegion.java            5658    checkSplit() calls 
                                  RegionSplitPolicy.getSplitPoint() on line 
                                  5678 to get split points
  RegionSplitPolicy.java          as an abstract class has two implementations
                                  IncreasingToUpperBoundRegionSplitPolicy.java
                                  and ConstantSizeRegionSplitPolicy.java
