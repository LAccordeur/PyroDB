1. check the index out of bound exception
2. StoreFileScanner.cur is initilized in seek(), so StoreFeilScanner.backwardSeek() should return true. which will add the scanner back to the heap. It seems to be the right logic, what went wrong? fix the index out of bound exception first. Add a static variable to indicate whether we have seen a index out of bound exception
3. the blockSeek() in PFileReader.java is not efficient enough. (a). seems not necessary to always test if the target key is smaller than the first key in the begining. (b) for scan of multiple cells, most times the next() in StoreScanner.java calls the blockSeek() just to seek to the next column. Therefore, it is not efficient to go through the entire skip pointers. But for skip on long distance, it is more efficient to evaluate large pointers first. Therefore, it is best to separate the seek behavior for StoreFileScanner init, and next column.
4. it needs a seek to go to the next column because it is possible that multiple versions of the same cell exists in the same StoreFile. Hence, the timestamp has to be another dimension in the key space. Otherwise, using the versioning will just cause us to fetch unnecessarily much data. 3D Moore curve is required, but can the third dimension (t) of different size of the other two (x, y)? TODO
